2. **NFL State API** - Successfully fetching season/week
3. **Schedule Fetch** - 26 rows for Week 8
4. **Snap Fetch** - 2252 rows for Week 7 (completed week)
5. **Database Insert** - All data being stored

---

## 📈 Expected Next Steps

### In Prefetch Cycle #2 (Current):

**Already Seen:**
- ✅ Schedule: 26 rows
- ✅ Snaps Week 8: 150 rows
- ✅ Snaps Week 7: 2000 rows
- ✅ Snaps Total: 2150 rows

**Still Coming in Logs:**
- 🔄 Injuries: ~200-300 rows expected
- 🔄 Practice Status: 0 rows (not Thu-Sat today?)
- 🔄 Usage Stats: ~1200-1500 rows expected (Week 7)

---

## 🚨 Important Observations

### 1. Week 8 Low Snap Data - EXPECTED ✅
```
WARNING - Low snap data coverage: 0.0% of sampled players
```

**Why this is OK:**
- Week 8 games haven't been played yet
- Sleeper API returns minimal/zero data for upcoming games
- This is **normal behavior**
- Week 7 data is what matters (completed games)

### 2. 2000 Row Limit - INTENTIONAL ✅
```
Snaps (week 7): 2000 rows inserted from 2252 fetched
```

**Why:**
- Code limits to 2000 rows to prevent memory issues
- See `server.py` line ~148: `subset = snap_rows[:2000]`
- 2000 players is more than enough for fantasy purposes
- 252 players truncated (likely backups/special teams)

### 3. Prefetch Running Every 60 Seconds ⚡
```
NFL_MCP_PREFETCH_INTERVAL=60
```

**Your Config:**
- Very aggressive (standard is 900s = 15 min)
- Great for development/testing
- May want to increase for production (300s recommended)

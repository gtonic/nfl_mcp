## Error Handling Patterns

All tools follow consistent error handling:

1. **Success Response**: `"success": true, "error": null`
2. **Validation Error**: `"success": false, "error": "Invalid parameter: ..."`
3. **Network Error**: `"success": false, "error": "Request timed out"`
4. **API Error**: `"success": false, "error": "HTTP 404: Not Found"`

**Always check the `success` field before processing data.**

---

## Performance Considerations

### Expensive Operations (Use Sparingly):
- `fetch_athletes` - Downloads 10MB+ dataset
- `crawl_url` - Network request + HTML parsing
- Any tool with external API calls

### Fast Operations (Local Database):
- `lookup_athlete`, `search_athletes`, `get_athletes_by_team` (after `fetch_athletes`)
- Local validation functions

### Rate Limiting:
- Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse
- Sleeper API has its own rate limits
- ESPN endpoints may be rate limited

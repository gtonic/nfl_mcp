### Basic Usage Example

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client("http://localhost:9000/mcp/") as client:
    # Get latest NFL news
    news = await client.call_tool("get_nfl_news", {"limit": 5})
    
    # Search for a player
    player = await client.call_tool("search_athletes", {"name": "Mahomes"})
    
    # Get team depth chart
    depth = await client.call_tool("get_depth_chart", {"team_id": "KC"})
```

### Sleeper Enhancements (Recent)

Recent upgrades to Sleeper tooling:
- Added losers bracket support: `get_playoff_bracket(league_id, bracket_type="losers")`
- Enforced explicit week for `get_transactions` (or alias round) to match official API
- Trending players now preserves Sleeper-provided `count` and enriches with local athlete data under `enriched`
- Added draft suite (`get_league_drafts`, `get_draft`, `get_draft_picks`, `get_draft_traded_picks`)
- Added full players dataset endpoint `fetch_all_players` with 12h in-memory TTL (returns metadata, not massive map)
- Added enrichment across core endpoints (rosters, matchups, transactions, traded picks, draft picks, trending)
- Automatic week inference for `get_transactions` (adds `auto_week_inferred`)
- Aggregator endpoint `get_fantasy_context` to batch league core data (optional `include`)
- Introduced central param validator utility (`param_validator.py`) for future consolidation
 - Robustness layer (retry + snapshot fallback) for: `get_rosters`, `get_transactions`, `get_matchups`
 - Snapshot metadata fields now returned:
   - `retries_used`: number of retry attempts consumed
   - `stale`: indicates if served data came from a snapshot beyond freshness TTL
   - `failure_reason`: last encountered failure code/category
   - `snapshot_fetched_at`, `snapshot_age_seconds`: present when snapshot used (or null on fresh)

#### Additional Enrichment (Schema v7)
New optional fields may appear within `players_enriched`, `starters_enriched`, and transaction add/drop enrichment objects:

| Field | Description | Source Values |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `snap_pct` | Offensive snap percentage for the current week (float, one decimal) | Derived or cached |
| `snap_pct_source` | Provenance for `snap_pct` | `cached`, `estimated` |
| `opponent` | Opponent team abbreviation (for DEF entries) | Schedule cache |
| `opponent_source` | Provenance for `opponent` | `cached`, `fetched` |

Notes:
- Estimated snap% uses depth-chart heuristics (starter‚âà70, #2‚âà45, others‚âà15) when real stats absent.
- All fields are additive and may be absent without breaking existing consumers.

#### Enhanced Enrichment (Schema v8)
Additional practice status & usage metrics (requires `NFL_MCP_ADVANCED_ENRICH=1`):

| Field | Description | Values/Format |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `practice_status` | Latest injury practice designation | DNP, LP, FP, Full |
| `practice_status_date` | Date of practice report | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `practice_status_age_hours` | Age of practice report in hours | Float (1 decimal) |
| `practice_status_stale` | Report older than 72h | Boolean |
| `usage_last_3_weeks` | Avg usage metrics (WR/RB/TE only) | Object (see below) |
| `usage_source` | Provenance for usage data | `sleeper`, `estimated` |
| `usage_trend` | Trend analysis per metric (WR/RB/TE) | Object (see below) |
| `usage_trend_overall` | Overall usage trend direction | `up`, `down`, `flat` |

**Usage Object Fields:**
- `targets_avg`: Average targets per game (1 decimal)
- `routes_avg`: Average routes run per game (1 decimal)
- `rz_touches_avg`: Average red zone touches per game (1 decimal)
- `snap_share_avg`: Average snap share percentage (1 decimal)
- `weeks_sample`: Number of weeks in sample (1-3)

**Usage Trend Object Fields:**
- `targets`: Trend for targets (`up`/`down`/`flat`)
- `routes`: Trend for routes run (`up`/`down`/`flat`)
- `snap_share`: Trend for snap percentage (`up`/`down`/`flat`)

**Notes:**
- Practice status helps identify injury risk (DNP = high risk, LP = moderate, FP/Full = low)
- Usage metrics provide true volume indicators beyond depth chart position
- Trend calculation compares most recent week vs prior weeks (15% threshold)
- Trend "up" (‚Üë) = rising usage, "down" (‚Üì) = declining usage, "flat" (‚Üí) = stable usage
- All fields are additive; absent fields mean data unavailable
- See [USAGE_TREND_ANALYSIS.md](USAGE_TREND_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed trend documentation


#### Robustness & Snapshot Behavior
Each robust endpoint attempts multiple fetches with backoff. If all fail, the server returns the most recent cached snapshot **with `success=false`** but still provides usable data so LLM workflows can continue gracefully. Always check:

```jsonc
{
  "success": false,
  "stale": true,
  "retries_used": 3,
  "failure_reason": "timeout",
  "snapshot_fetched_at": "2025-09-13T11:22:33Z",
  "snapshot_age_seconds": 642
}
```

For fresh successful responses the snapshot fields are present with `null` values (allowing uniform downstream parsing).

#### Aggregator Quick Use
```
get_fantasy_context(league_id="12345", include="league,rosters,matchups")
```
If `week` omitted it will be inferred from NFL state. Response includes `week` and `auto_week_inferred`.

#### Updated Transactions Behavior
Calling `get_transactions(league_id)` without `week` now attempts inference; falls back to validation error only if NFL state unavailable.

### Architecture Improvements

**Simplified Design** (v2.0):
- ‚úÖ **Single Tool Registry** - All tools defined in one place
- ‚úÖ **92% Code Reduction** - Server simplified from 766 to 59 lines

async with Client("http://localhost:9000/mcp/") as client:
    # Get NFL state
    result = await client.call_tool("get_nfl_state", {})
    print(f"Current NFL week: {result.data['nfl_state']['week']}")
    
    # Get trending players
    result = await client.call_tool("get_trending_players", {
        "trend_type": "add",
        "limit": 10
    })
    print(f"Found {result.data['count']} trending players")
    
    # Get league information (requires valid league_id)
    result = await client.call_tool("get_league", {"league_id": "your_league_id"})
    if result.data["success"]:
        print(f"League: {result.data['league']['name']}")
        
    # Strategic planning - Preview upcoming challenges
    result = await client.call_tool("get_strategic_matchup_preview", {

## Security Considerations

This server implements several security measures:

- **Enhanced Input Validation**: 
  - String inputs are validated against injection patterns (SQL, XSS, command injection)
  - Numeric parameters have type checking and range validation
  - URL validation includes private network blocking and dangerous pattern detection
- **Content Sanitization**: Web crawled content is sanitized to remove scripts and dangerous patterns
- **URL Security**: Only HTTP/HTTPS URLs are allowed with additional security checks
- **Request Timeouts**: All HTTP requests have reasonable timeout limits (30s total, 10s connect)
- **User-Agent Headers**: All requests are properly identified
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use parameterized statements
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting utilities to prevent abuse
- **No Code Execution**: The server does not execute arbitrary code or eval statements

**Input Validation Features:**
- SQL injection pattern detection and prevention
- XSS injection pattern detection and prevention  
- Command injection pattern detection and prevention
- Path traversal pattern detection and prevention
- HTML content sanitization with script removal
- Team ID, League ID, and other parameter format validation
- Safe character pattern matching for different input types

**Rate Limiting:**
- Configurable per-endpoint rate limiting
- In-memory storage for development (Redis recommended for production)
- Customizable limits and time windows
- Rate limit status reporting

When deploying in production:
- Run in a containerized environment
- Use proper network security controls
- Implement persistent rate limiting with Redis or similar
- Monitor for unusual request patterns
- Keep dependencies updated
- Consider additional WAF (Web Application Firewall) protection

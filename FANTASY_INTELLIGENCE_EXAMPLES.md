# Fantasy Intelligence API Usage Examples

This document provides practical examples of how to use the new Fantasy Intelligence APIs to make informed fantasy football decisions.

## Quick Start Examples

### 1. Pre-Game Lineup Decisions

```python
# Check injury status before setting your lineup
injuries = await client.call_tool("get_team_injuries", {"team_id": "KC", "limit": 20})

for injury in injuries.data["injuries"]:
    if injury["severity"] == "High":
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  AVOID: {injury['player_name']} ({injury['position']}) - {injury['status']}")
    elif injury["severity"] == "Medium":
        print(f"‚ö° RISKY: {injury['player_name']} ({injury['position']}) - {injury['status']}")
```

### 2. Waiver Wire Research

```python
# Analyze team motivation for potential pickups
standings = await client.call_tool("get_nfl_standings", {"season": 2025})

for team in standings.data["standings"]:
    if team["motivation_level"] == "High (Playoff hunt)":
        print(f"üî• {team['abbreviation']}: {team['fantasy_context']}")
        
        # Get their players to see who might get more opportunities
        players = await client.call_tool("get_team_player_stats", {"team_id": team["abbreviation"]})
        fantasy_players = [p for p in players.data["player_stats"] if p["fantasy_relevant"]]
        print(f"   Fantasy relevant players: {len(fantasy_players)}")

# Enhanced waiver wire analysis with de-duplication
waiver_dashboard = await client.call_tool("get_waiver_wire_dashboard", {"league_id": "your_league_id"})

if waiver_dashboard.data["success"]:
    summary = waiver_dashboard.data["dashboard_summary"]
    print(f"üìä Waiver Wire Dashboard:")
    print(f"   Total transactions: {summary['total_waiver_transactions']}")
    print(f"   Duplicates removed: {summary['duplicates_removed']}")
    print(f"   Volatile players: {summary['volatile_players_count']}")
    
    # Check for volatile players (dropped and re-added)
    if waiver_dashboard.data["volatile_players"]:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Volatile players to avoid:")
        for player_id in waiver_dashboard.data["volatile_players"]:
            print(f"   - Player ID: {player_id}")
```

### 3. Matchup Analysis

```python
# Analyze upcoming matchups for your players
schedule = await client.call_tool("get_team_schedule", {"team_id": "KC", "season": 2025})

upcoming_games = [g for g in schedule.data["schedule"] if g["result"] == "scheduled"][:4]

for game in upcoming_games:
    opponent = game["opponent"]["abbreviation"]
    home_away = "vs" if game["is_home"] else "@"
    
    print(f"Week {game['week']}: {home_away} {opponent}")
    for implication in game["fantasy_implications"]:
        print(f"  üí° {implication}")
```

### Waiver Wire Intelligence

## Daily/Weekly Routine Examples

### Daily Check (Game Days)

```python
async def daily_fantasy_check():
    """Quick daily check for any breaking injury news."""
    
    # Your key players' teams
    priority_teams = ["KC", "BUF", "SF"]  # Adjust for your roster

        if urgent_injuries:
            print(f"üö® {team} URGENT:")
            for injury in urgent_injuries:
                print(f"   {injury['player_name']} ({injury['position']}) - {injury['status']}")
        else:
            print(f"‚úÖ {team} - No urgent injury concerns")
```

### Weekly Planning Session

```python
async def weekly_planning_session(week_number):
    """Comprehensive weekly fantasy planning."""
    
    print(f"üìä Week {week_number} Fantasy Planning Session")
    print("=" * 50)

    for team in top_teams[:5]:  # Sample first 5
        injuries = await client.call_tool("get_team_injuries", {"team_id": team, "limit": 3})
        fantasy_injuries = [i for i in injuries.data["injuries"] 
                          if i["position"] in ["QB", "RB", "WR", "TE"] and i["severity"] != "Low"]
        
        if fantasy_injuries:
            print(f"   {team}: {len(fantasy_injuries)} fantasy-relevant injuries")
    
    # 2. Standings check for motivation

    print(f"\n3. Week {week_number + 1} Preview...")
    preview_team = "KC"  # Example team
    schedule = await client.call_tool("get_team_schedule", {"team_id": preview_team})
    
    next_games = [g for g in schedule.data["schedule"] 
                 if g["result"] == "scheduled"][:2]
    
    for game in next_games:
        opponent = game["opponent"]["abbreviation"]
        home_away = "vs" if game["is_home"] else "@"
        print(f"   {preview_team} Week {game['week']}: {home_away} {opponent}")
        for implication in game["fantasy_implications"][:1]:  # First implication
            print(f"      üí° {implication}")

# Usage
await weekly_planning_session(week_number=15)
```

## Integration with Existing APIs

### Combine with Sleeper Data

```python
async def enhanced_roster_analysis(league_id, user_id):
    """Combine new APIs with existing Sleeper data for comprehensive analysis."""
    
    # Get your current roster from Sleeper
    rosters = await client.call_tool("get_rosters", {"league_id": league_id})
    your_roster = next((r for r in rosters.data["rosters"] if r["owner_id"] == user_id), None)
    
    if not your_roster:
        return "Roster not found"
    
    # Map player IDs to teams (this would require additional logic in real implementation)
    # For example purposes, assume we have this mapping
    player_teams = {
        "4881": "KC",  # Mahomes
        "4035687": "KC",  # Kelce
        # ... more mappings
    }
    
    print("üèà Enhanced Roster Analysis")
    print("-" * 40)
    
    for player_id in your_roster["players"]:
        if player_id in player_teams:
            team = player_teams[player_id]
            
            # Get injury report for player's team
            injuries = await client.call_tool("get_team_injuries", {"team_id": team})
            
            # Check if this specific player is injured
            player_injury = next((i for i in injuries.data["injuries"] 
                                if player_id in str(i.get("player_id", ""))), None)
            
            if player_injury:
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Player {player_id} ({team}): {player_injury['status']}")
            else:
                print(f"‚úÖ Player {player_id} ({team}): Healthy")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Rate Limiting Awareness
- Don't call APIs too frequently
- Cache results when appropriate
- Batch requests when possible

### 2. Data Freshness
- Injury reports change frequently - check daily
- Standings update weekly during season
- Schedules are mostly static but check for changes

### 3. Fantasy Context Interpretation
- High severity injuries = likely sit
- Medium severity = monitor closely
- Low motivation teams late season = consider alternatives
- Playoff hunters = prioritize their players

### 4. Error Handling
```python
async def safe_api_call(tool_name, params):
    """Safely call API with error handling."""
    try:
        result = await client.call_tool(tool_name, params)
        if not result.data.get("success", True):
            print(f"API Error: {result.data.get('error', 'Unknown error')}")
            return None
        return result.data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Network Error: {e}")
        return None

# Usage
injuries = await safe_api_call("get_team_injuries", {"team_id": "KC"})
if injuries:
    # Process data safely
    pass
```

These examples show how to leverage the new Fantasy Intelligence APIs to make data-driven decisions that can help you "win the fantasy league by having an always up to date team with strong players."

## Strategic Sleeper API Usage

The following examples demonstrate the strategic use of Sleeper API tools to plan for future events (matchups, bye weeks) early enough for competitive advantage.

### Multi-Week Strategic Preview

```python
async def strategic_season_planning(league_id, current_week=8):
    """Use Sleeper API strategically to plan multiple weeks ahead."""
    
    print(f"üìä Strategic Season Planning - Starting Week {current_week}")
    print("=" * 60)
    
    # Get strategic preview for next 6 weeks
    preview = await client.call_tool("get_strategic_matchup_preview", {
        "league_id": league_id,
        "current_week": current_week,
        "weeks_ahead": 6
    })
    
    if preview.data.get("success"):
        strategic_data = preview.data["strategic_preview"]
        
        print(f"\nüìà Analysis Period: {strategic_data['analysis_period']}")
        
        # Show critical bye weeks coming up
        critical_byes = strategic_data["summary"]["critical_bye_weeks"]
        if critical_byes:
            print(f"\nüö® CRITICAL BYE WEEKS AHEAD:")
            for bye in critical_byes:
                print(f"   Week {bye['week']}: {bye['team']} on bye")
        
        # Show high opportunity weeks
        opportunity_weeks = strategic_data["summary"]["high_opportunity_weeks"]
        if opportunity_weeks:
            print(f"\nüéØ HIGH OPPORTUNITY WEEKS: {', '.join(map(str, opportunity_weeks))}")
            print("   ‚Üí Good weeks to be aggressive with lineup decisions")
        
        # Show challenging weeks
        challenging_weeks = strategic_data["summary"]["challenging_weeks"]
        if challenging_weeks:
            print(f"\n‚ö†Ô∏è  CHALLENGING WEEKS: {', '.join(map(str, challenging_weeks))}")
            print("   ‚Üí Start planning backup options now")
        
        # Show trade recommendations
        trade_recs = strategic_data["summary"]["trade_recommendations"]
        for rec in trade_recs:
            print(f"\nüí° STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION: {rec}")
    
    return preview.data

# Usage
await strategic_season_planning("your_league_id_here", current_week=8)
```

### Season-Long Bye Week Coordination

```python

## Best Practices for Strategic Sleeper API Usage

### 1. Timing is Everything
- **Early Season (Weeks 1-4)**: Use `get_season_bye_week_coordination()` to plan entire season
- **Mid Season (Weeks 5-10)**: Use `get_strategic_matchup_preview()` weekly for tactical decisions  
- **Trade Season (Weeks 8-13)**: Use `get_trade_deadline_analysis()` to optimize timing
- **Playoff Prep (Weeks 11+)**: Use `get_playoff_preparation_plan()` for readiness assessment

### 2. Strategic Integration
- Combine Sleeper league data with NFL schedule insights
- Use bye week forecasting to plan trades 2-3 weeks early
- Coordinate waiver claims with upcoming matchup difficulties
- Balance short-term needs with playoff preparation

### 3. Competitive Advantage
- Most managers only look 1 week ahead - these tools give you 4-8 week vision
- Early identification of bye week clusters allows proactive roster moves
- Trade deadline timing optimization can secure better deals
- Playoff preparation scoring helps prioritize the right players

### 4. Automation Opportunities
```python
# Set up weekly strategic check
async def weekly_strategic_check():
    """Automated weekly strategic assessment."""
    
    current_week = 9  # Update this weekly or get from NFL state
    league_id = "your_league_id_here"
    
    # Quick strategic pulse check
    preview = await client.call_tool("get_strategic_matchup_preview", {
        "league_id": league_id,
        "current_week": current_week, 
        "weeks_ahead": 3
    })
    
    # Alert on critical upcoming issues
    if preview.data.get("success"):
        summary = preview.data["strategic_preview"]["summary"]
        
        if summary["critical_bye_weeks"]:
            print("üö® ALERT: Critical bye weeks detected in next 3 weeks!")
            
        if len(summary["challenging_weeks"]) >= 2:
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Multiple challenging weeks ahead - prepare now!")
        
        if summary["trade_recommendations"]:
            print("üí° OPPORTUNITY: Strategic trade window identified!")

# Run this every Tuesday during the season
await weekly_strategic_check()
